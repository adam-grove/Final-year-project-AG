Comparitive Analysis of Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry Pipelines 
# Study Abstract 
Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry (DI-MS) is a valuable tool for metabolomics research, offering rapid and efficient analysis of complex biological samples. Unlike chromatographic techniques that require prior separation of analytes, DI-MS directly introduces the entire sample into the mass spectrometer, enabling rapid profiling of metabolites. Data generated by DI-MS is complex and requires processing solutions or “pipelines” to effectively analyse the data. This study evaluated three commonly used data processing pipelines: DIMSpy, MALDIquant and MZmine3. Using a standardised benchmark dataset, we compared their performance regarding feature detection, clustering and usability. All pipelines effectively differentiated between sample groups but exhibited variations in feature identification and clustering patterns. DIMSpy, while identifying fewer features, demonstrated a higher proportion of biologically relevant ones, suggesting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery. MZmine3, despite identifying the greatest number of features, showed limited overlap with the other pipelines, indicating the possible inclusion of noise-related features. MALDIquant identified the lowest proportion of biologically relevant features, likely due to its specificity and preprocessing needs. Usability evaluation revealed DIMSpy as the most user-friendly, while MZmine3 offered extensive customisation options. The choice of pipeline depends on the researcher’s needs and experience. This study highlights the need for standardised data processing methods in DI-MS analysis. Future research should focus on developing hybrid pipelines and improving the ability to identify biologically relevant features. By addressing these challenges, DI-MS analysis will be more accurate and repeatable.
